# Online Resume

I was too lazy to do my resume on word, so I did this React webpage instead!

- Easy to maintain: it's only React and CSS 🌈
- Data-driven: all the content in one folder
- Easy to share: it's deployed to S3 and PDF generation is done on the fly!

Save a tree, don't print it 🌲

## PDF generation

PDF generation is done by an AWS Lambda 👩‍🏭

[PDF Generator Lambda](https://github.com/PierreVaut/pdf-generator-lambda).
