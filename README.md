# my-cv

The project was to deliver a static React webpage that replaces my A4 resume.
- Easy to maintain: it's only React and CSS.
- Data-driven: all the content is in a unique folder.
- Easy to share: it's built and deployed to S3 in one command.

## Todo

Thing I want to add in a near future:
- Handle different languages
- Handle PDF generation on the fly
- SASS
